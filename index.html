                <p>Hello, my name is David Joseph (I am not sure what the goat's name is), and I have been building and deploying websites since 2017. You may recognize my work with organizations such as PlanetaryCARE.org and TopCarGuys.com, or maybe you've seen my profile on Upwork. If this is our first time being introduced to each other, then the pleasure is mine. I am excited to get started on your next project, and I'm looking forward to seeing what we can create together. I have extensive experience with Front-End Web Development utilizing HTML CSS and JavaScript, as well as popular CMS platforms such as WordPress and Shopify - With these technologies, I can bring nearly any design to life. Once you're finished having a look around, you can fill out the contact form below. I'll reach out to you shortly after, so we can start discussing the details of your next project. Thank you for stopping by!</p>

Using Google's speed test/optimization tool (Along with other tools), I can identify elements that could be affecting your site's speed. From there, I'll make adjustments.</p>

This application was built using React.js, and is designed to help you stay on top of your daily tasks. When a user visits this site, they will have the ability to add a note title, as well as a note description. After hitting enter, a new node/section for the newly typed note will be created dynamically. In other words, you can add as many notes to this page as you'd like, and they will show!</p>

I had friends who started their own businesses, so my heart truly went out to them at this time. The Daily Jerky is an example of a business that was started by a friend of mine, and I didn't want to see his business fail. I offered to help get him set up on Shopify, so he wouldn't miss out on any sales. He is still open to this day - Click "View Project" to see his website</p>
